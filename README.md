            <h2><span class="emoji">‚≠ïÔ∏è‚ùåÔ∏è</span> Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The **Tic Tac Toe Game** is a classic 2-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with X's and O's. The player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this simple game lets you challenge your friends or play against the computer.</p>
